## 1. **Purpose**:
-  The problem to be solved is the need to improve the management processes of the organization in order to achieve the strategic goals of the organization.
The working hypothesis of the study is that assessing employee satisfaction with the management processes in an organization allows us to identify the most important processes, the implementation of which processes employees are least satisfied with.

## 2. **The survey questions are structured into groups:**
-  Overall assessment of employee satisfaction.
-  Private assessment of employee satisfaction.
-  Evaluation of employee satisfaction with the organization and content of work activities.
-> We will divide the types of questions from these 3 surveys into 2 main categories: Human and Facilities/Operations!
   
## 3. **List of questions (references) that can help analyze the data:**
  - What is the level of loyalty of each type of personnel?
  - How do employees evaluate career and personal development opportunities?
  - What is the effect of psychological well-being?
  - What integrated metrics can be used to compare the results of each questionnaire?
  - What do employees think about the efficiency of business processes?
    ...
## 4. **Important KPIs**
  *In the 2 files Private Satisfied and Organization and content of work activities, there is an additional column "Evaluation of the importance of factors", so we will use the 2 KPIs below instead of the average evaluation score.*
  - GAP SCORE: The gap between how important an employee thinks a factor is (a survey question), and how satisfied they actually are with that factor.
    → Helps identify “hot spots” – where employees feel it is very important but are very dissatisfied.
      `GAP SCORE = Importance Score - Normalized Satisfaction Score`
  - ACTION PRIORITY INDEX (API): This is a composite index between importance and urgency (Gap Score) → helps rank which issues need action the soonest.
      `Action Priority Index = Importance Score × GAP SCORE`
## 5. **Summary of Findings**
  - Employees (165 people) participated in all 3 surveys, however the number of responses for each question type was different.
  - Doctors (67 people) and medical staff (45 people) accounted for the largest number, followed by service staff (34 people) and administration (19 people).
  - The average rating score in the Overall Survey was at the average level or higher (for all 4 employee groups). So we will focus on the 2 surveys Private and Organization and content of activities.
  - With the Private survey, the doctor group and the administrator group on the first floor have a higher number of dissatisfied ratings (in both types of questions).
    * Administrator group: questions with low ratings include: Timeliness of information, having a teamspirit, Accessibility of electronic resources...
    * Doctor group: questions with low ratings include: Material Reward, Timeliness of information, Accessibility of electronic resources, Relationship between remuneration and work results
    * Medical Staff group: questions with low ratings include: Material Reward, Timeliness of information, Relationship between remuneration and work results
    * Service Staff group: questions with low ratings include: Material Reward, Relationship between remuneration and work results, Oppoturnities for advanced training
  - With the Orgnization and content of activities survey, similar to private survey, the doctor group and the administrator group on the first floor have a higher number of dissatisfied ratings (in both types of questions)
    * Administrator group: questions with low ratings include: Sales Through Insurance Companies, Marketing Research, Sale of paid services, Calculation of wages from extra-budgetary funds
    * Doctor group: questions with low ratings include: Calculation of wages from extra-budgetary funds, Calculation and accrual of wages according to the budget, Development and provision of a personnel, Motivation system, Budget planning ,Purchase of equipment.
    * Medical Staff group: questions with low ratings include: Calculation of wages from extra-budgetary funds, Calculation and accrual of wages according to the budget, providing working conditions, purchase of equipment, Development and provision of a personnel motivation system
    * Service Staff group: questions with low ratings include: providing working conditions, purchase of equipment

## 6. **Key Issues and Improvements**
  The hospital is facing core issues related to internal communications, compensation policies, working conditions, and financial management. These issues affect employee satisfaction, especially the medical and administrative teams on the first floor. To improve, the hospital needs to:
  * Improve internal communications to ensure timely and effective information transmission.
  * Review compensation policies to ensure fairness and transparency.
  * Invest in facilities, equipment, and advanced training to support staff work.
  * Enhance team spirit and develop clearer marketing and sales strategies for the administrative team.
